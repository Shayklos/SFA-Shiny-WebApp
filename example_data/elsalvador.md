Data are from Programa Ambiental de El Salvador or PAES, an environmental program promoting crop diversification and soil conservation practices. The total sample size is 459.

The database `elsavadordata.csv` contains the cross-section of farmers sampled in 2005. For each farmer, the following variables are available:
 - **louput**: log of the total value of production, measured in dollars.
 - **lland**: log to the total cultivated area (in manzanas where one manzana=0.7 has).
 - **llabour**: log of the total number of workers (family + hired).
 - **lseeds**: log of the value of seeds used (measured in dollars).
 - **lfertilizers**: log of the value of fertilizers used (measured in dollars).
 - **lpesticides**: log of the value of pesticides used (measured in dollars).
 - **Participation**: dummy variable for participation into the soil conservation program. 1 if farmer has participated, and 0 otherwise.
 - **fullten**: dummy equal to 1 if the farmer owns all her cultivated land, and 0 otherwise.
 - **ageold60**: dummy equal to 1 if the farmer is 60 and older and 0 otherwise.
 - **maxeduc**: highest level of education in the farmer`s household (measured in years).
 - **nooutinc**: dummy equal to 1 if the farmer has no outside sources of income and 0 otherwise.
 - **footaccess**: dummy, equal to 1 that indicates whether farmers have only walking access to their plot, and 0 otherwise.
 - **caraccess**: dummy equal to 1 that indicates whether farmers also have access by car to their plot, and 0 otherwise.
 - **riskmax**: defined as a continuous variable which compares the relative diversification of each farmer with respect to the average farmer. A higher value of the riskmax index implies higher risk diversification. 
 - **valorjornal**: average daily wage within the 'canton`.
 - **fam_electricidad**: proportion of families living in the same 'canton` with access to electricity.
 - **fam_letrinas**: proportion of families in the farmer`s canton with access to private bathrooms.
 - **diste1**: log-distance (measured in kilometers) from the epicenter of the earthquake in 2001.
 - **dum01**: Dummy for region 1.
 - **dum02**: Dummy for region 2.
 - **dum03**: Dummy for region 3.
 - **dum04**: Dummy for region 4.
